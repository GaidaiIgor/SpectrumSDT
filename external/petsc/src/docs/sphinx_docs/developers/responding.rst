Responding to User Requests and Questions
=========================================

PETSc users communicate to the PETSc team via two mailing lists:
petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov and petsc-users@mcs.anl.gov. When responding to
such inquiries, please follow the guidelines given below.

* Be polite.
* Address the person by name (when you can determine the name).
* Apologize for the problem when it is appropriate (but not otherwise).
* Thank the person for his or her patience if it is more than six hours since the report came in.
* If the person drops the ``petsc-maint`` or ``petsc-users`` from the reply list, add it back in.
* Donâ€™t ask too many questions or give too many suggestions in the same email. The user often responds only to the first of them or becomes confused.
