Creating a 3-dimensional structured regular mesh of 2x2x2 in memory and creating a DM object.
Generate the MOAB mesh hierarchy with 2 levels.
Level 0
DM Object: Coarse Mesh 1 MPI processes
  type: moab
  Coarse Mesh in 3 dimensions:
    Sizes: cells=8, vertices=27, blocks=1
    Boundary trace:
      cells=8, faces=24, vertices=26
    Fields: 1 components
      [0] - DEFAULT
Level 1
DM Object: 1 MPI processes
  type: moab
    Sizes: cells=64, vertices=125, blocks=1
    Boundary trace:
      cells=56, faces=96, vertices=75
    Fields: 1 components
      [0] - DEFAULT
Level 2
DM Object: 1 MPI processes
  type: moab
    Sizes: cells=512, vertices=729, blocks=1
    Boundary trace:
      cells=296, faces=384, vertices=263
    Fields: 1 components
      [0] - DEFAULT
