   Note: mapping from local to global is scalable; but global
  to local may not be if the range of global values represented locally
  is very large.

   Note: the ISLocalToGlobalMapping is actually a private object; it is included
  here for the inline function ISLocalToGlobalMappingApply() to allow it to be inlined since
  it is used so often.

     ISColoring - sets of IS's that define a coloring

   Level: intermediate

    Notes:
        One should not access the *is records below directly because they may not yet
    have been created. One should use ISColoringGetIS() to make sure they are
    created when needed.

        When the coloring type is IS_COLORING_LOCAL the coloring is in the local ordering of the unknowns.
    That is the matching the local (ghosted) vector; a local to global mapping must be applied to map
    them to the global ordering.
