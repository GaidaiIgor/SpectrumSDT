<H2> DMDA</H2>

The DMDA class encapsulates a Cartesian structured mesh, with interfaces for both topology and geometry. It is capable of parallel refinement and coarsening. Some support for parallel redistribution is available through the PCTELESCOPE object. A piecewise linear discretization is assumed for operations which require this information.
