    Information on VecScatter used in matrix-vector product: 
    [0] Number sends = 2; Number to self = 0
    [0]   0 length = 4 to whom 1
    [0]   1 length = 4 to whom 2
    Now the indices for all remote sends (in order by process sent to)
    [0] 0 
    [0] 1 
    [0] 2 
    [0] 3 
    [0] 0 
    [0] 1 
    [0] 2 
    [0] 3 
    [0] Number receives = 1; Number from self = 0
    [0] 0 length 2 from whom 1
    Now the indices for all remote receives (in order by process received from)
    [0] 0 
    [0] 1 
    [1] Number sends = 2; Number to self = 0
    [1]   0 length = 2 to whom 0
    [1]   1 length = 2 to whom 2
    Now the indices for all remote sends (in order by process sent to)
    [1] 0 
    [1] 1 
    [1] 0 
    [1] 1 
    [1] Number receives = 1; Number from self = 0
    [1] 0 length 4 from whom 0
    Now the indices for all remote receives (in order by process received from)

    [2] Number sends = 0; Number to self = 0
    [2] Number receives = 2; Number from self = 0
    [2] 0 length 4 from whom 0
    [2] 1 length 2 from whom 1
    Now the indices for all remote receives (in order by process received from)
