Here is the list of problems where we have issues:

  24 - fails on destroy with an object in an invalid state; succeeds with nf_const = 50
  33, 34, 35, 40, 42, 49 - fails due to inf -- the matlab function evaluation is not causing it.
  18, 27, 28, 36, 47, 50, 51 - slow convergence

History vectors are not properly sized (they are too big) and the code does not check if
there is room prior to adding more vectors.  This can lead to memory corruption errors.
